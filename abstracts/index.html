<td align="left">We present the optical transmission spectrum of the highly inflated Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-21b, using three transits obtained with the ACAM instrument on the William Herschel Telescope through the LRG-BEASTS survey (Low Resolution Ground-Based Exoplanet Atmosphere Survey using Transmission Spectroscopy). Our transmission spectrum covers a wavelength range of 4635-9000Å, achieving an average transit depth precision of 197ppm compared to one atmospheric scale height at 246ppm. Whilst we detect sodium absorption in a bin width of 30Å, at &gt;4 sigma confidence, we see no evidence of absorption from potassium. Atmospheric retrieval analysis of the scattering slope indicates that it is too steep for Rayleigh scattering from H2, but is very similar to that of HD189733b. The features observed in our transmission spectrum cannot be caused by stellar activity alone, with photometric monitoring and Ca H&amp;K analysis of WASP-21 showing it to be an inactive star. Our work demonstrates that WASP-21b is an excellent target for future infra-red observations to constrain its atmospheric metallicity, and could be a key comparison planet to the JWST Early Release Science Program target WASP-39b.</td>

<td align="left">The evolution of high multiplicity planetary systems has remained an analytically unsolved problem for hundreds of years; assessing the stability of these systems is usually done through computationally expensive N-body simulations. Instead, we apply machine learning classification methods to short numerical integrations of diverse planetary systems in order to predict the fate of planets after 10 Myr. We find that training a gradient boosting algorithm on dynamically motivated features&ndash; the quantities the classifier uses to make predictions&ndash; yields an accurate classifier that uses significantly less computational power than traditional numerical methods. We investigate features&rsquo; predictive power on the fates of individual planets and explore the reasons for misclassifications. Beyond the context of our own Solar System, with exoplanet discovery missions such as TESS observing a wealth of new data, such research can help us characterize the potential past evolution of exoplanetary systems we discover.</td>

<td align="left">Nora Bailey (University of Chicago). <em>Period Ratio Sculpting Near Second-Order Mean-Motion Resonances</em>. <strong>6.1</strong></td>
<td align="left">Second-order mean-motion resonances lead to an interesting phenomenon in the sculpting of the period ratio distribution due to their shape and width in period-ratio/eccentricity space. As the osculating periods librate in resonance, the time-averaged period ratio approaches the exact resonance location. The width of second order resonances increases with increasing eccentricity, and thus more eccentric systems have a stronger peak at the resonance location when averaged over sufficient time. The libration period is short enough that this time-averaging behavior is expected to appear on the timescale of the Kepler mission. In this talk, I will present results obtained from N-body integrations of simulated planet pairs near the 5:3 and 3:1 mean-motion resonances. I will demonstrate how these results constrain the eccentricity distributions of real Kepler planets near second-order resonance, placing an upper limit on the Rayleigh scale parameter, σ, at σ = 0.245 (3:1) and σ = 0.095 (5:3) at 95% confidence.</td>

<td align="left">Corey Beard (University of California, Irvine). <em>AO Follow Up for High Value HPF Targets</em>. <strong>4.1</strong></td>
<td align="left">Abstract: With the advent of TESS and the discovery of thousands of TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), Adaptive Optics (AO) observations of stars have become a vital tool for ruling out close companions. Binary star systems are extremely common in the Milky Way, and frequently masquerade as transiting exoplanets, or as radial velocity (RV) signatures. AO observations are a fast way of ruling out such close-companion explanations, and allow us to push forward with RV results, with confidence.  Our team uses the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (HPF) for RV follow up of many interesting planet candidates, and I have developed a pipeline that reduces AO data taken at Lick Observatory to compliment these efforts. This AO data has proven for multiple systems that AO data still has great value in ruling out close companions.   I will introduce the concepts of AO image reduction, the generation of contrast curves, and the ruling out of close companions. I will spend most time highlighting some interesting HPF targets that have used Shane AO data in their analysis, or will use it in the near future.</td>

<td align="left">Ultra-hot Jupiters represent an exciting avenue for testing extreme physics and observing atmospheric circulation not found in our solar system. These high temperatures result in ionized particles moving through the atmosphere, generating magnetic fields in the planet. Until now, treatment of magnetic drag in 3D models of ultra-hot Jupiters has been uniform drag timescales applied evenly throughout the planet. In this work, we apply our locally calculated active magnetic drag treatment in our GCM of the planet WASP-76b. We find the effects of this treatment to be most visible in the upper atmosphere, with strong differences between the day and night side circulation. This treatment of magnetic drag will help aide our understanding of the atmospheric circulations of ultra-hot Jupiters.</td>

<td align="left">Galen Bergsten (University of Arizona). <em>Kepler’s Planet Radius Valley as a Function of Stellar Mass</em>. <strong>5.1</strong></td>
<td align="left">The “radius valley” is a feature in the short-period, small exoplanet population (in Kepler and K2 data) showing an abundance of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, with a relatively scarce population of intermediate-sized planets between the two. Several studies explore the radius valley’s dependence on host star properties, specifically stellar age and mass, with a wide range of treatments to the population of small close-in planets. Correcting for survey/vetting biases without the unnecessary removal of data is essential to studying the true distribution of small planets and their host stars. We employ updated stellar properties and implement refined measures of completeness and reliability to observe how the Kepler small planet population varies as a function of stellar mass. These results are extrapolated into the Habitable Zone, placing an estimate on the occurrence rate of habitable, Earth-like planets that still retain their atmospheres. We further attempt to constrain the degree of stripped cores “contaminating” the super-Earth population as a function of period. Our ongoing efforts connect these findings to planetary evolution, and will help constrain models of photoevaporation and core powered mass loss.</td>

<td align="left">Ell Bogat (NASA GSFC / CRESST II / SURA). <em>Predictions for High-Contrast Imaging of Confirmed Exoplanets with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</em>. <strong>T</strong></td>
<td align="left">The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) will expand the range of directly imaged exoplanets to cold Jovian analogs observed in reflected visible light. In this talk, we share predictions for the mass and orbit retrieval of such planets using CGI. We have modeled the relative astrometry and fluxes of a preliminary “shortlist” of confirmed exoplanets that are favorable target candidates for CGI. For planets whose exact mass and orbit inclination are unknown (as is the case with most planets discovered through radial velocity measurements), we model a range of inclination cases from 20- to 90-degrees and infer the remainder of the orbital parameters necessary for modeling.  For each planet and inclination case, we analyze the simulated data assuming only a few available observation epochs. By comparing the “true” planet parameters to the “measured” parameters that we extract, we predict the ability of the Roman CGI to perform orbit and mass retrieval of the target planet in the ideal case. We aim to evaluate the best known planets to image during the 5-year prime mission of the Roman Space Telescope, and to provide insight into the geometrical constraints of exoplanet characterization and orbit retrieval with direct imaging.</td>

<td align="left">Kiersten Boley (The Ohio State University). <em>Constraining the Metallicity required for Planet Formation</em>. <strong>3.1</strong></td>
<td align="left">Planet formation has been shown to be strongly correlated with host star metallicity, which is thought to be a proxy for disk solids. Observationally, previous works have indicated that planets preferentially form around stars with solar and super solar metallicities. Given these findings, it is challenging to form planets within metal-poor environments, particularly for hot Jupiters that are thought to form via metallicity-dependent core accretion. We present a study of hot Jupiters around metal-poor stars to understand how the lack of metals stifles planet formation. Previous studies on this topic have been limited due to small sample sizes. However, with the vast amount of high-quality data sets from TESS, it is now possible to probe planet occurrence in the metal-poor regime. We use a large sample of halo stars observed by TESS to constrain the upper limit of hot Jupiter occurrence within the metal-poor regime (-2.0 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ -0.6). Placing the most stringent upper limit on hot Jupiter occurrence, we found the mean 1-σ upper limit to be 0.19 % for radii 0.8 -2 RJ and periods 0.5−10 days. This result is consistent with previous predictions indicating that there exists a certain metallicity below which no planets can form.</td>

<td align="left">Adaptive optics (AO) instrumentation is essential when conducting seeing-limited observations from ground-based facilities.   Replacing a telescope&rsquo;s static secondary mirror with an adaptive secondary mirror provides a way to streamline the AO system and reduce the thermal background in mid-infrared observations.   In this poster, I discuss how adaptive secondary mirrors could be employed to expand the set of directly imaged exoplanets and increase the throughput of radial velocity surveys.  I provide an overview of three next-generation adaptive secondary mirrors in development for the UH88 telescope, Automated Planet Finder, and the W.M. Keck Observatory.</td>

<td align="left">Hot Jupiters under extreme flux from their host stars can exhibit mass loss and an extended atmosphere that can be detected by transit observations in the near-UV. We present observations of WASP-121 b and other hot giant planets using the Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) in the UVM2 band (λc = 2246 Å). We compare the near-UV transit depths to new optical observations with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). In some cases, the data suggest a deeper transit, but not to a significant degree due to the low precision of the Swift observations. For WASP-121b, higher precision NUV measurements with the HST have already confirmed a deeper transit. Further observations will be needed to confirm deeper transits of the other planets. Our results demonstrate the utility of the UVOT as a tool to study transiting hot Jupiters.</td>

<td align="left">Garett Brown (University of Toronto). <em>Quantifying the Effects of Weak Stellar Flybys on the Solar System</em>. <strong>6.4</strong></td>
<td align="left">The architecture and evolution of planetary systems are shaped in part by stellar flybys. The strength and frequency of stellar flybys vary over system lifetimes as local stellar environments mature. Within this context, we look at flyby encounters which are too weak to immediately destabilize a planetary system but are nevertheless strong enough to measurably perturb a system&rsquo;s dynamical state. We estimate the strength of such perturbations on a secularly evolving system using a simple analytic model and confirm those estimates with direct N-body simulations. We then run long-term integrations of our own Solar System and show that even small perturbations from stellar flybys can significantly affect the stability of planetary systems over their lifetime.  Due to the coupled nature of the Solar System, we find that small perturbations to Neptune&rsquo;s orbit cascade inward, increasing the likelihood that the inner Solar System will destabilize. We find that interactions which change the semi-major axis of Neptune by &gt;0.03 AU are significantly more likely to destabilize the Solar System.</td>

<td align="left">Aritra  Chakrabarty (Indian Institute of Astrophysics). <em>Probing the Hot-Jupiter Atmospheres through Polarized Reflected Light</em>. <strong>T</strong></td>
<td align="left">Polarimetric studies of hot-Jupiters are gaining momentum in the exoplanet community as these studies provide an alternative way to probe their atmospheres. Atmospheric scattering causes the starlight reflected from a planet to be polarized in the optical and NIR region and the net disk-integrated polarization should be non-zero owing to the asymmetrical illumination of the planetary disk. In this talk, I will present a novel approach to calculate the azimuth-dependent reflected intensity vectors at each location on the planetary disk by solving the vector radiative transfer equations that describe the linear polarization as well as a numerical recipe to integrate those intensity vectors over the disc to get the reflected flux and its state of polarization. Our calculations incorporate self-consistent atmospheric models of exoplanets over a wide range of equilibrium temperature, surface gravity, atmospheric composition, and cloud structure. I will also present our models for the well-studied hot-Jupiter HD189733b for different chemical compositions and cloud structures, indicating the level of precision required by future observations to detect the polarization from this planet. The generic nature and the accuracy offered by our models make them an effective tool for modeling the future observations of the polarized light reflected from exoplanets.</td>

<td align="left">Ryan Challener (University of Michigan). <em>A Three-Dimensional Exoplanet Eclipse Mapping Technique for the JWST Era</em>. <strong>T</strong></td>
<td align="left">Atmospheric retrieval and mapping are key tools to understanding the behavior of exoplanet atmospheres. Due to past and current data limitations, present analyses are one- or two-dimensional. These analyses can be biased, since exoplanet atmospheres are inherently three-dimensional, with at least dusk and dawn terminators, offset hotpots, day-night temperature contrasts, and poles. With the advent of JWST, a three-dimensional approach will be required to accurately model the data. Here, we present a method to vertically combine maximally-informative thermal maps, calculated individually from each spectral channel, to perform a simultaneous three-dimensional retrieval using spectroscopic eclipse observations. We discuss applications to synthetic observations of HD 209458 b, in preparation for JWST data. This software, once complete, will be made available as an open source tool for the community.</td>

<td align="left">Greg Cooke (University of Leeds (UK)). <em>Oxygen’s 2.4 billion year control on Earth’s atmosphere with consequences for exoplanet biosignatures</em>. <strong>8.1</strong></td>
<td align="left">Since the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen (O₂) concentrations have fluctuated until reaching modern day levels, with O₂ now comprising 21% of the atmosphere. Given the geological history of terrestrial bodies in the solar system, telescopes will likely find an exoplanet in a particular geological regime, with the Proterozoic being the longest geological period from Earth’s history. Chemistry-climate simulations using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) will be presented, where oxygen concentrations were altered from pre-industrial levels to possible Proterozoic levels of 10%, 1%, 0.5%, and 0.1% of the present atmospheric level. These simulations represent not only Earth through time, but possible Earth-analogue exoplanets that orbit a Sun-like (G-type) star. Reduced O₂ changes the chemical regimes for these atmospheres and lowers the ability for atmospheric CH₄ to accumulate. With a reduced O₃ shield, enhanced photolysis produces increased chemical destruction in a Proterozoic-like atmosphere, such that possible transmission spectra observations of these inhabited exoplanets will likely result in a false-negative (a null result) for detecting the presence of life. Thus, at least for transmission spectra, dedicated larger telescopes would be needed to confirm biosignatures on these Earth-analogue exoplanets during an equivalent Proterozoic-like period.</td>

<td align="left">Miles Currie (University of Washington). <em>Informing planetary environmental context with the ELTs</em>. <strong>1.4</strong></td>
<td align="left">In the near future, we will be able to search for life, habitability, and evolved planetary climates on terrestrial exoplanets using extremely large ground-based telescopes (ELTs). The ELTs can access the visible and near infrared wavelengths, where the O2 bands are prominent, and will complement the James Webb Space Telescope’s strength in longer wavelength molecule detection. Although O2 is the most readily detectable biosignature on an Earth-like world for high-resolution observations, using the ELTs to detect other environmental molecules or alternative biosignatures has not been fully explored. To better understand the accessibility of environmental context using ground-based telescopes, we simulate high-resolution observations of Earth-like atmospheres orbiting a range of M-dwarf hosts, ensuring photochemical consistency with each host star’s spectral type. Using the cross-correlation technique, we determine the detectability of O2, O3, CH4, CO2, CO, and H2O in these atmospheres. We match the O2 detectability calculations of previous studies, and show that CH4 and CO2 are potentially accessible for nearby systems. Our results demonstrate that the upcoming ELTs could play a major role in terrestrial exoplanet characterization beyond O2 detection, and can inform observing strategies for future space-based direct imaging missions.</td>

<td align="left">Fei Dai (Caltech). <em>TOI-1444b and a Comparative Analysis of the Ultra-short-period Planets with Hot Neptunes</em>. <strong>T</strong></td>
<td align="left">We report the discovery of TOI-1444b, a 1.4-$R_\oplus$ super-Earth on a  0.47-day orbit around a Sun-like star discovered by {\it TESS}. We measured planetary mass to be $3.87 \pm 0.71 M_\oplus$. TOI-1444b joins the growing sample of 17 ultra-short-period planets with measured masses and sizes, most of which are compatible with an Earth-like composition. We take this opportunity to examine the expanding sample of ultra-short-period planets ($&lt;2R_\oplus$) and contrast them with the newly discovered sub-day hot Neptunes ($&gt;3R_\oplus$ TOI-849 b, LTT9779 b and K2-100). We find that 1) USPs have predominately Earth-like compositions with inferred iron core mass fractions of 0.32$\pm$0.04; and have masses below the threshold of runaway accretion ($\sim 10M_\oplus$), while sub-day hot Neptunes are above the threshold and have H/He or other volatile envelope. 2) USPs are almost always found in multi-planet system consistent with a secular interaction formation scenario; hot Neptunes tend to be ``lonely&rsquo;&rsquo;. 3) USPs occur around solar-metallicity stars while hot Neptunes are mainly found around higher metallicity stars. 4) In all these respects, the sub-day hot Neptunes show more resemblance to hot Jupiters than the smaller USP planets, although sub-day hot Neptunes are rarer than both USP and hot Jupiters by 1-2 orders of magnitude.</td>

<td align="left">Zoe de Beurs (University of Texas at Austin). <em>Exoplanet Detection Using AI: Removing Stellar Activity Signals from Radial Velocity Measurements Using Neural Networks</em>. <strong>T</strong></td>
<td align="left">Exoplanet detection with precise radial velocity (RV) observations is currently limited by spurious RV signals introduced by stellar activity. Here we show that machine learning techniques (linear regression, neural networks) can effectively remove these activity signals from RV observations. Previous efforts have focused on carefully filtering out activity signals in time using Gaussian process regression (e.g. Haywood et al. 2014). Instead, we separate activity signals from true center-of-mass RV shifts using only changes to the average shape of spectral lines, and no information about when the observations were collected. We demonstrate our technique on simulated data, reducing the RV scatter from 82.0 cm/s to 3.1 cm/s, and on approximately 700 observations taken nearly daily over three years with the HARPS-N Solar Telescope, reducing the RV scatter from 1.47 m/s to 0.78 m/s (a 47% or factor of ≈ 1.9 improvement). In the future, these or similar techniques could remove activity signals from observations of stars outside our solar system and eventually help detect habitable-zone Earth-mass exoplanets around Sun-like stars. In this way, improvements in RV precision could significantly accelerate the characterization of habitable zone Earth-sized exoplanets.</td>

<td align="left">We present high-resolution, near-infrared spectra taken during eight transits of 55 Cancri e, a nearby low-density super-Earth with a short orbital period (&lt; 18 hours). While this exoplanet&rsquo;s bulk density indicates a possible atmosphere, one has not been detected definitively. Our analysis relies on the Doppler cross-correlation technique, which takes advantage of the high spectral resolution and broad wavelength coverage of our data, to search for the thousands of absorption features from hydrogen-, carbon-, and nitrogen-rich molecular species in the planetary atmosphere. Although we are unable to detect an atmosphere around 55 Cancri e, we do place strong constraints on the levels of HCN, NH3, and C2H2 that may be present. Our results reduce the parameter space of possible atmospheres consistent with a previous analysis of HST/WFC3 observations by Tsiaras et al. (2016), and indicate that if 55 Cancri e harbors an atmosphere, it must have a high mean molecular weight and/or clouds.</td>

<td align="left">The amount of water on the early solar system (SS), at the moment of Earth formation, is believed to be relatively low in the inner SS. For this reason different mechanisms of water delivering toward Earth have been propose to explain the formation of its ocean. One possible mechanism to drive the migration of water bearing planetesimals from the outer region of the SS toward Esrth is the gravitational perturbation produced by the migration, and/or growth, of giant planets. We propose that a similar migratory effect can by achieve if its considered the recoil force, or thrust, due to the out-gassing of volatile elements that are buried on planetesimals. To explore the effect of this thrust force in the evolution of planetesimals of the SS we run a set of N-Body simulations. We show that the volatile thrust can drive outer planetesimals (a&gt;2.5AU) toward the inner SS in a few Myrs.  Also we show that even in the absence of giant planets the volatile thrust can feed the inner planets with enough water bearing planetesimals in order to form an ocean, which not only has important consequences for the SS but also for ocean formation in exoplanets.</td>

<td align="left">More than two dozens of Warm Jupiters have been found with nearby companions, including many with a companion in/near orbital resonances. To understand the formation of such systems, we explore the in-situ and disk-driven migration origin channels of Warm Jupiters and how these two formation pathways affect the companion properties of Warm Jupiters. We simulate a disk of isolation mass embryos with either an inward migrating Jupiter or allowing one massive embryo to grow to a Jupiter mass planet. Using the N-body code REBOUND and REBOUNDx, we evolve the system for the protoplanetary disk stage and the stage after the disk dissipation. Our preliminary results show that Warm Jupiter migration enhances embryo collisions and produces Neptune-mass embryos trapped into its mean-motion resonance. In the poster, I will present the resulting planetary system architectures from the two scenarios and discuss the similarities/differences in the companion properties. I will also make predictions on the observed companion properties for the transit and radial-velocity surveys.</td>

<td align="left">Characterising a star in great detail is vital for understanding exoplanets. This is because stellar physics can impact important exoplanet parameters such as radii, mass, and planet atmosphere determinations. Understanding the formation, migration and evolution of exoplanets is of fundamental importance when considering the existence of life outside our solar system. Furthermore, understanding stellar physics can be crucial when searching for low mass, long period planets (Earth-twins) due to signals being lost within stellar ‘noise’. In this talk, we will present our most recent results utilising the reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin (RRM) technique on the 2016 Sun/Mercury transit with HARPS-N. The RRM uses transiting planets to probe and spatially resolve the star, investigating stellar properties such as differential rotation and centre-to-limb convective variations. By doing this we are able to measure the differential rotation and use it to decouple the projected equatorial velocity of the star, to measure the stellar inclination. We can combine this with the projected obliquity to determine the true 3D obliquity. Overall, the Sun/Mercury transit is a test (as we already know the solar and planetary properties) allowing for further validation of the method and will aid in exploring potential degeneracies.</td>

<td align="left">Since the dawn of times, humankind has wondered about the formation and volatile composition of planet atmospheres. Connecting the observed composition of exoplanets to their formation sites often involves comparing the observed planetary atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio to a disk midplane model with a fixed chemical composition. In this scenario, chemistry evolution in the midplane prior to and during the planet formation era is not considered. The C/O ratios of gas and ice in disk midplane are simply defined by volatile icelines in a midplane of fixed chemical composition. However, kinetic chemical evolution during the lifetime of the gaseous disk can change the relative abundances of volatile species, thus altering the C/O ratios of planetary building blocks. In my chemical evolution models, I utilize a large network of gas-phase, grain-surface and gas-grain interaction reactions, thus providing a comprehensive treatment of chemistry. In my talk, I will show how chemical evolution can modify disk midplane chemistry, and how this affects the C/O ratio of giant planet-forming material. I will argue that midplane chemical evolution needs to be addressed when predicting the chemical makeup of planets and their atmospheres.</td>

<td align="left">In the early stages of their lives, stars very often are part of a binary pair or a higher order multiple. Such a prevalence of binary systems means that they should be included in discussions of the evolution of exoplanetary systems. We utilize a hybrid symplectic integrator to evolve a system of s-type planets in a co-planar binary that is in turn evolved through an embedded cluster environment. In a non-negligible number of cases, the cluster perturbs the binary companion onto an eccentric orbit, causing an orbital instability in the 4 gas giants that we place around the primary. In addition to characterizing these instabilities, we also look at the changes in orbital architecture for the planetary systems that have undergone a loss of 1 or more planets. We find that there is a marked difference in the eccentricity and spin-orbit angle distributions of planetary systems that have undergone an instability compared to those that remain stable for the duration of our 10 Myr simulations. The preference for these unstable systems to occupy higher spin-orbit angles than their stable counterparts indicates that interactions with a binary companion could be a source of highly inclined hot jupiters seen in exoplanet observations.</td>

<td align="left">Young transiting exoplanets (&lt; 100 Myr) provide crucial insight into atmospheric evolution. However, detailed transmission spectroscopy and measuring atmospheric mass loss is made even more challenging due to the general increased activity and prominent disk inhomogeneities present on young stars. Here, I will present spectroscopic observations of a full transit of V1298 Tau c, a 23 Myr planet orbiting a young solar analogue, from January, 2020. Through detailed analysis, we find evidence that V1298 Tau c is transiting at an active latitude. Additionally, we find that H-alpha smoothly decreases during the transit. While this could be a tentative detection of an extended young atmosphere, we find this variation is consistent with other young stars observed over six hours. We show this variation can also be explained by the presence of starspots and facular regions. More observations both in- and out-of the transits of V1298 Tau c are required to determine the nature of the H-alpha detection.</td>

<td align="left">As most stars tends to aggregate in dense clusters, it is interesting to study the dynamics of planetary systems in these systems to explain the proprieties of the exoplanets found in our Galaxy. Using the NBODY6++GPU code for the star cluster dynamics and REBOUND for the planetary systems, integrated in the AMUSE environment, we present how Solar-like systems interact with the clustered environment. We use different clusters&rsquo; initial conditions, changing virial ratio and stellar density, evolving all clusters for 50 Myr. The encounter strength, the relative velocity of the encountering star and the star cluster density are the main factors that alter the planetary system architecture.  Since the Solar system is one of the most complex planetary system, we explore the influence of the star cluster on it. The entire planetary systems survive in the majority of cases, but other systems have either lost the most external planets, and others have lost all of them. However, in most cases, their orbital parameters result perturbated from their original configuration, and the secular evolution is slightly changed, in respect of the field star scenario.</td>

<td align="left">The habitable zone around a low-mass star is not static. Many planets that currently orbit within their host star’s habitable zone have lost water due to photodissociation from high XUV radiation from their host star in the past. Whether a planet is habitable after this runaway greenhouse phase depends both on how much water remains in the planetary system and whether greenhouse warming from atmospheric carbon dioxide prevents habitable surface temperatures. We simulate the interior thermal evolution of the planet to estimate abundances of water and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from eruption rates. We also simulate the evolution of the host star to calculate the rate of water loss prior to the planet entering the habitable zone. We validate our model by reproducing the 92 bars of carbon dioxide and 30 ppm of water vapor observed in Venus’ atmosphere today. We then apply this validated model to calculate the coupled atmosphere-interior evolution of the potentially habitable TRAPPIST-1 planets, assuming Earth-like compositions. We find that planets that have outgassed too much carbon dioxide during their runaway greenhouse phase will, despite being in the habitable zone, become Venus-like worlds with thick carbon dioxide atmospheres and no liquid water.</td>

Weak and broad spectral lines make the radial velocity detection method difficult for main-sequence A and B-type stars.

One star can be used as an interferometric reference, making it possible to achieve ≈10 micro-arcsecond precision on relative position.

<td align="left">Recently, several extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) spectrographs have been providing high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra with the express purpose of exoplanet discovery and characterization. A significant barrier to this endeavor is the existence of time-variable features in the spectra from both telluric absorption and stellar variability. Traditional methods discard significant portions of data to minimize the effects of telluric contamination, but new data-driven methods may enable the use of a larger fraction of the available data. While there exist methods for modeling out the telluric features (e.g. Bedell et al. 2019) or the stellar variability (e.g. Gilbertson et al. 2020) individually, there is a need for new tools that are capable of modeling them simultaneously. Here we present StellarSpectraObservationFitting.jl (SSOF), a Julia package for creating data-driven linear models for the time-variable spectral features in both the observer and observed frames. SSOF outputs estimates for the radial velocities, template spectra in both the observer and barycentric frames, and scores that quantify temporal variability of time-variable telluric and stellar features.  The resulting model can be used to aid in mitigating remaining sources of correlated noise in the radial velocity time series and improving the effective precision of upcoming exoplanet surveys.</td>

<td align="left">Ultracool dwarfs, a mix of the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs (substellar object too low mass to initiate stable hydrogen fusion), are the lowest mass products of star formation. The lack of a stable internal energy source causes brown dwarfs to cool as they age, causing them to exhibit a mass-luminosity-age relation, which complicates efforts to measure their fundamental parameters (e.g. M, Teff). We have obtained the first high-resolution (R˜45,000) H- and K-band spectral sequence of ultracool dwarfs using the Immersion Grating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS). Our sequence spans the spectral types from M1.5V to T6, and includes known low-gravity objects at six spectral types ranging (M9, L0, L1, L2, L3, L5), which we plan to use to empirically search for gravity sensitive features.

<td align="left">Observations and modelling of exoplanet atmospheres are exciting frontiers of current research, with oxygen, ozone and methane in combination considered a potential biosignature. An improved understanding of how these gases interact with one another and how their concentrations have evolved on Earth can aid understanding of their evolution in other planetary atmospheres. Ozone and O2 concentrations are closely related, as shown by previous 1-D photochemical models, which used fixed mixing ratio lower boundary conditions. Here, we revise the classic results using fixed flux lower boundary conditions in our photochemical model, and show a bimodal distribution for model Earth atmosphere solutions. Most solutions have either trace O2/O3 (pO2 &lt; 6×10-7 atm) or high O2/O3 (pO2 &gt; 2×10-3 atm) concentrations. This confirms previous biogeochemical modelling studies, suggesting that O2 levels in the window between may be unstable to small perturbations in flux, and therefore unlikely to have existed for long periods of time on Earth. We use these constraints to suggest that pO2 in the middle part of Earth’s history may have been at least 1% of the present atmospheric level, which is higher than some geological evidence proposes. Our results demonstrate the importance of carefully prescribing model boundary conditions.</td>

<td align="left">The exoplanet yield of the ongoing TESS mission is expected to surpass that of Kepler, and the relatively bright stars observed by TESS will significantly enhance the potential of RV follow-up. Yet TESS is more sensitive to detection biases than its predecessor, as close to 75% of the sky coverage of the TESS primary mission has a continuous time baseline of just 27 days. In these regions of the sky, TESS will observe no more than a single transit for any exoplanet with an orbital period longer than a month. The orbital parameters that can be derived for these “single-transit planet candidates” (STPCs) will be poorly constrained relative to those derived for exoplanets observed to transit multiple times, posing a challenge for follow-up observations. But these long-period planets are nevertheless worth confirming and characterizing. Here, I present a framework for maximizing the efficiency of RV observations of STPCs. By leveraging information on exoplanet populations from Kepler, I show that it is possible to develop an informed follow up strategy even without strong constraints on the orbital period or eccentricity. I also highlight how this information can be used to design dynamic, adaptive observing schemes for queue-based instruments such as NEID.</td>

<td align="left">Modern exoplanet searching heavily relies on various adaptations of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to ascertain the frequency information from unevenly sampled radial velocity measurements. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram suffers from strong spectral leakage, where it reports spurious variance estimations at a given frequency caused by relatively far-away frequencies, making it difficult to correctly extract planetary signals. We introduce an adapted version of the Bronez [1988] multitaper method for generating a much more accurate frequency-domain representation of radial velocity measurements. By using a set of multiple, orthogonal tapering functions, we can minimize the spectral leakage in frequency, obtain control over a bias vs variance trade-off, and produce spectra with high dynamic range. Because each taper provides an independent estimate of the power spectrum, we are also able to average over these estimates in leave-one-out fashion to generate confidence intervals on the power spectra. We will present multitaper power spectra of radial velocity and stellar activity measurements for 3 star systems and compare these with their Lomb-Scargle counterparts. We aim to demonstrate that our mitigation of spectral leakage provides optimal circumstances for the identification of planetary signals.</td>

<td align="left">Irregular satellites are the minor bodies found orbiting all four Solar System giant planets with large semimajor axes, eccentricities, and inclinations. Previous studies have determined that the Solar System&rsquo;s irregular satellites are extremely collisionally evolved populations today, having lost ≈99% of their initial mass over the course of hundreds of Myr. In this paper, we show that circumstellar disks can result from the dust generated by these collisions. Radiation pressure, quantified by the parameter beta, is the driving force behind the liberation of dust grains from the planetary Hill sphere. Our simulated disks reproduce many of the same features seen in observed debris disks, such as thin ring morphology, a large blowout size, and azimuthal symmetry. We identify a critical intersection of (beta≈0.1, t≈10 years) that tells us the minimum size at which dust grains can exit the Hill sphere and how long it will take. Since a relation exists between beta, dust grain size, and observing wavelength, this also provides a future road map for observers. We find that our systems satisfy the definition of a narrow ring put forth by Hughes et al. (2018), $\Delta R / R &lt; 0.5$.</td>

These population models can now be used to make predictions about the presence and properties of additional planets in systems with known transiting planets. Here, I will describe how we use a statistical model for the distribution of planetary systems to compute the conditional occurrence of planets given a Kepler-detectable planet. While unseen planets may potentially be discovered by radial velocity (RV) follow-up observations, they can also add a source of systematic error in efforts to fit the semi-amplitude (K) of the transiting planet. I will show that attempts to measure the K of the transiting planet when there are an unknown number of planets often requires significantly more observations than in the ideal case (when there are no additional planets). Planets around 10 day periods, common among the TESS planet candidates, with K comparable to the single-measurement RV precision typically require ≈100 observations to measure their K to within 20% error. These results highlight an important and previously unaccounted for source of error in measuring the masses of transiting planets with RV follow-up, which should be considered when planning RV surveys.</td>

By better understanding the occurrence rates of these types of planets in every stage of a star’s life, we can better understand their fate and hope to favor one formation/evolution mechanism over another. In this context, it is crucial to estimate the population of these weird planets around young stars. Unfortunately, probing young stars is notoriously difficult due to their strong magnetic activity (or ‘jitter’) inducing spurious radial velocity (RV) signals that often mask the planet(s) RV signature(s) used to detect them. I started my PhD by attempting to recover simulated planetary signatures hidden behind real stellar RV data exhibiting large jitter to grasp the limit of our capabilities.

Overall, the extended mission TOIs are similar to the prime mission TOIs in terms of period and radius distribution.

The far-UV emission from flares can dissociate atmospheric species, abiotically generate biosignatures and exacerbate atmospheric erosion. Yet, the near-UV flux from flares may be necessary for the emergence of life on rocky planets around low-mass stars such as TRAPPIST-1. A detailed knowledge of the UV energies and rates of flares is therefore essential for our understanding of the habitability of exoplanets around low-mass stars. However, measurements of UV flare rates require expensive campaigns with HST. Because of this, current habitability studies use UV flare rates based on extrapolations from white-light optical surveys such as TESS. However, despite their use in contemporary habitability studies, such extrapolations are untested and their accuracy at any age or activity level remains unconstrained. To this end, we have combined TESS white-light and archival GALEX UV photometry for a set of M dwarfs to test the UV predictions of habitability studies.

I will report on our investigation of a particular migration theory in which a warm Jupiter is coupled to a perturbing companion planet that excites secular eccentricity oscillations in the warm Jupiter, leading to periodic close stellar passages that can tidally shrink and circularize its orbit. If such companions exist in warm Jupiter systems, they are likely to be massive and close-in, making them potentially detectable. We generate a set of warm Jupiter-perturber populations capable of engaging in high-eccentricity tidal migration and calculate the detectability of the perturbers. We show that a small percentage of these perturbers should be detectable in the Kepler lightcurves, but most should be detectable with precise radial velocity measurements over a 3-month baseline and Gaia astrometry. We find these results to be robust to the assumptions made for the perturber parameter distributions. If a high-precision radial velocity search for companions to warm Jupiters does not find evidence of a significant number of massive companions over a 3-month baseline, it will suggest that perturber-coupled high-eccentricity migration is not the predominant delivery method for warm Jupiters.</td>

<td align="left">Recently, the TOI-700 System was characterized as the first habitable-zone Earth-sized planet using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Ground-based follow-up combined with diagnostic vetting and validation tests enables this system to rule out common astrophysical false-positive scenarios and validate the planetary data.  However, TESS systems are restricted by a Nyquist limit that can interfere with internal structure data, especially at different oscillation modes. Another key limitation is the necessity of an ultra-stable light source for standardization purposes. Although several studies have shown promise, reliable data has yet to be validated.

<td align="left">In its all-sky survey of transiting exoplanets, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has detected thousands of transiting exoplanet candidates, most of which orbit nearby M-dwarf stars. In order to characterize these systems, ground based follow up is needed, which requires a precise characterization of the host star. Currently, the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF)—a near-infrared spectrograph on the 10m Hobby-Eberly Telescope—is conducting the HPF-TESS program, an ongoing follow-up program to characterize promising transiting M-dwarf planet candidates from TESS. In this talk, I will discuss the HPF-SpecMatch code, a tool we developed to empirically determine stellar parameters (effective temperatures, metallicities, and surface gravities) using a library of as-observed stars with HPF, with a particular focus on M-dwarf systems. We have used HPF-SpecMatch to characterize the stellar properties of three TOI M-dwarf planet-hosting systems published by our team—including TOI-1266, a multi-planet system of two planets where one planet sits in the Exoplanet Radius Valley, and TOI-1899, the first warm Jupiter discovered orbiting an M-dwarf—with more systems in preparation. The code for HPF-SpecMatch will be made public in a forthcoming publication, opening doors for further accurate and precise characterizations of stars and their exoplanets using high-resolution near-infrared spectra.</td>

<td align="left">With the advent of a new generation of instrumentation, we’re developing the capabilities to measure precise planetary parameters for planets orbiting M dwarfs. In this presentation, I will discuss novel statistical techniques which leverage the precise measurements of planetary and stellar properties, by using nonparametric methods of modelling and inference. These models allow us to jointly model the exoplanet mass, radius, and insolation along with stellar mass and metallicity. In particular for the low mass M dwarfs, the dependence on stellar mass can be quite pronounced due to the large variation in stellar mass across the spectral sub type (≈ 6x - 7x).   I will discuss a few examples of the application of this technique: in particular with respect to the trends seen in the Jupiter and Neptune planet populations with respect to different stellar parameters. Another such example is the change in radius-period gap with stellar mass, metallicity and insolation. These high dimensional frameworks offer a holistic approach to study the interdependence of various observed exoplanet and host stellar properties.</td>

<td align="left">Stellar activity poses one of the main obstacles for the detection and characterisation of exoplanets around cool stars, as it can induce radial velocity (RV) signals that can hide or mimic the presence of companions. Several activity indicators are routinely used to identify activity-related signals in RV measurements, but not all indicators trace exactly the same effects, nor are any of them always effective in all stars. In this work, we evaluate the performance of a set of common spectroscopic activity indicators for 98 M dwarfs observed with CARMENES. We find that different indicators behave differently depending on the mass and activity level of the target star. In addition, we also observe that stars at the low-mass end of the sample show the lowest RV scatter, which could potentially hint at different manifestations of activity compared to higher-mass stars, as well as being better candidates for planet searches. Overall, our results show that when assessing the origin of an RV signal, it is critical to take into account a large set of indicators, or at least the most effective ones considering the characteristics of the star, as failing to do so may lead to false planet claims.</td>

<td align="left">Accurate modeling of exoplanet atmospheres can help inform and constrain observations. Current efforts to model exoplanet atmospheres primarily focus on minimal-complexity one-dimensional models, which miss some key atmospheric mechanisms, and high-complexity computationally expensive three-dimensional models. Therefore there is a natural gap for 2D shallow-water equations models. Many previous such models are built in Fortran, which makes them difficult to adapt to the needs of exoplanet science. Our model, SWAMP-E (Shallow-Water Atmospheric Model in Python for Exoplanets), can accurately and rapidly explore vast parameter space. The code is flexible, modular, built fully in Python, and could be easily adapted to model a variety of dissimilar space objects, from Brown Dwarfs to smaller, terrestrial planets. The Python code will produce the thermal maps necessary for the generation of phase curves and secondary eclipse maps, which will help constrain and make predictions for observations.  We intend to make the code open-source to serve the planetary science community. Here I will present the circulation regimes we have explored in hot Jupiters and discuss plans for future exploration of smaller, cooler planets.</td>

<td align="left">Planets form and obtain their compositions in dust- and gas-rich disks around young stars.  Dust substructure at the au-to-10 au scale is commonplace in these disks, as revealed by the DSHARP program, but far fewer observations have probed gas substructure at similar scales. To address this, I will present initial results from the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) Large Program, which explores radial and vertical chemical structures at 10 au scales in five disks where dust substructure is detected and planet formation appears to be ongoing. The MAPS observations reveal a striking diversity in the radial morphologies of molecular line emission in protoplanetary disks. Chemical substructures are ubiquitous and extremely varied with a wide range of radial locations, widths, and depths. This suggests that planets form in diverse chemical environments both across disks and at different radii within the same disk. I will discuss the implications of these findings in the context of interactions between gas and dust substructures and the volatile and organic compositions of incipient planets. I will also provide some conclusions about what MAPS is teaching us about the chemistry of planet formation and how this relates to the observed diversity of known exoplanetary systems.</td>

<td align="left">1I/2017 (`Oumuamua), the first-detected interstellar interloper near the Earth, provided an unprecedented view of a small body that originated outside of the Solar nebula. Surprisingly, the large inferred Galactic population of similar objects from the detection of `Oumuamua at a geocentric distance of 0.16AU is in slight tension with current models of planetesimal production in protoplanetary disks. Furthermore, `Oumuamua’s physical and dynamical properties do not fit within the current astronomical taxonomy and may demand an explanation outside of conventional avenues of exoplanetary system formation. One such interpretation is that `Oumuamua contained a component of molecular hydrogen ice. In this presentation, we discuss the compatibility of this substance with observations of `Oumuamua and examine the feasibility of building these objects. We focus on the starless cores of Giant Molecular Clouds, the only known environments which could reach the frigid conditions necessary for hydrogen ice deposition. Via energy balances arguments, simple analytic and numerical models of accretion, and the classic Kolmogorov framework of turbulence, we characterize the possibilities for growth and barriers to assembly in size regimes ranging from micron-sized dust to required kilometer-scale progenitors of `Oumuamua. Finally, we provide predictions on interstellar objects relevant to the Vera Rubin Observatory.</td>

<td align="left">The newest generations of EPRV (extreme-precision radial velocity) instruments are reaching levels of precision where the primary factor limiting detection of small planets is no longer instrumental but rather astrophysical in origin. Stellar spectroscopic variability as a result of convective and magnetic activity can produce quasi-periodic RV variations at the m/s level, completely drowning out small-amplitude planetary signals. An increasingly popular method for addressing these challenges is to observe the Sun &ndash; the most well-characterized star by far &ndash; with small solar telescopes coupled to these instruments, producing rich and homogeneous data sets with which to test strategies and algorithms for mitigating stellar activity as well as instrumental systematics.  We have built a solar feed system to carry out these “Sun-as-a-star” observations with NEID, the new EPRV instrument on the WIYN 3.5m at Kitt Peak National Observatory, and we will soon be releasing the solar data publicly for the community to use.

This project makes use of the unique dataset presented by EXPRES solar spectra to determine if we can see the impact of starspots in the spectra.

We find M_b = 10.4 +/- 0.9 and M_c = 7.2 +/- 1.4 Earths, which are low compared to most known planets of comparable radii. The RVs yield only an upper-limit on M_d (&lt;5.8 Earths at 2 sigma).

Despite its non-transiting geometry, secular interactions indicate that planet e is nearly coplanar (Inclination &lt; 10 degrees).

<td align="left">A planet’s surface conditions can significantly impact its climate and habitability. In this work, we use the 3D general circulation model ExoPlaSim to systematically vary dayside land cover on a tidally locked rocky planet under two extreme and opposite continent configurations: either all of the land or all of the ocean is centred at the substellar point. We identify water vapour and sea ice as competing drivers of climate, and we identify land-dependent regimes under which one or the other dominates. We find that land fraction and distribution can change the globally averaged surface temperature by up to 15K, and water vapour by up to an order of magnitude. The most discrepant models have partial dayside land cover with opposite continent configuration. Since these planets’ surfaces will not be directly observable using transit spectroscopy, I will discuss how these climate differences likely represent a fundamental uncertainty in the climates of tidally locked planets, even if their atmospheric composition is well-known.</td>

<td align="left">When observing exoplanet atmospheres, the possible effects of weather are often ignored. There is clearly global weather on Solar System planets and is likely on exoplanets as well, although there is little theoretical guidance on what to expect. These atmosphere observations are time-intensive, so most are only observed once and we assume this single epoch shows the atmosphere in equilibrium, with no temporal variability. No exoplanet has received repeat phase curve observations at the same wavelength, leaving this assumption untested.  Atmospheric data is our primary insight into compositions and formation scenarios, so understanding potential time variability in the data is important. I will present three Spitzer/IRAC phase curves of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b. These are the first repeat infrared phase curves of a single exoplanet, expanding upon existing repeat eclipse measurements since phase curves probe global weather, rather than just the dayside. We did not see significant variation between the three phase curves, allowing us to place strict limits on the presence of weather on WASP-43b.

<td align="left">Lava planets are rocky planets that orbit closely to their host stars and much of their surfaces are covered with molten magma. These planets are hot enough to vapourize rocks which creates a thin mineral vapour atmosphere. Due to these planets&rsquo; extreme orbital configuration, lava planets are some of the best targets to observe an extra-solar terrestrial atmosphere. K2-141b is a recently discovered lava planet and we simulate its atmosphere using an idealized hydrodynamical model. The model determines the atmospheric temperature, wind velocity, and surface pressure which are then used to simulate future observations of K2-141b. We tested for an Na, SiO and SiO2 dominant atmosphere and found that the Na atmosphere, with 14 kPa surface pressure, is thickest while the SiO2 atmosphere, with 240 Pa, is thinnest. However, the SiO2 atmosphere is warmer which makes it easier to observe via spectroscopy. We also estimate the ocean circulation required to maintain surface-atmosphere mass balance and found that Na redistribution in the ocean is orders of magnitude larger than the bulk silicate flow. This suggests that a steady-state Na atmosphere cannot be sustained, and the planet’s surface will evolve over time.</td>

Given the small amplitude of the depletion (≈0.05 dex), previous analyses have relied on high signal-to-noise stellar spectra and a strictly differential approach to determine elemental abundances of nearby solar analogs relative to the Sun. In this work, we develop an alternative hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach that can be applied to larger samples of stars with lower precision abundance measurements. Using chemical abundance determinations from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2) and the stellar parameter and chemical abundance pipeline (ASPCAP DR16), we place constraints on the statistical properties of the elemental abundances, including correlations with condensation temperature and the fraction of stars with refractory element depletions. We find evidence for two populations: a refractory depleted population of stars that make up the majority of solar analogs including the Sun, and a comparatively refractory enriched population of stars that make up between 10-30% of our solar neighborhood sample. Such trends, if robustly linked to the formation of planetary systems, provide a means to connect stellar chemical abundance patterns to planetary systems over large samples of Milky Way stars.</td>

The host system&rsquo;s overall architecture is a hierarchical quadruple in the &lsquo;2+2&rsquo; configuration, owing to the presence of a companion system of two M-dwarfs. We show that a secular inclination resonance in 2+2 systems can significantly broaden the LK window for extreme eccentricity excitation (e &gt; 0.999), allowing the giant planet to migrate for a wide range of initial orbital inclinations. Octupole effects can also contribute to the broadening of the &lsquo;extreme&rsquo; LK window. By requiring that perturbations from the companion stars be able to overcome short-range forces and excite the planet’s eccentricity to an extreme value, we obtain an absolute lower limit for the planet’s semimajor axis just before migration. We find that, if WD1856b migrated via the 2+2 resonance, it most likely originated from ≈30-60 AU (or ≈10-20 AU during the host&rsquo;s main-sequence phase).

Advances in high-resolution spectroscopy in the near-infrared have opened up the possibility of improving M dwarf analysis. There have recently been several methods published on fitting the observed high-resolution spectra with synthetic spectra using different instruments and theoretical approaches. We present a comparison of stellar parameters derived by three different approaches for 11 different stars in common between three studies. The derived effective temperature values agree within uncertainties for most stars while the surface gravity and metallicity show a larger spread. For half of the stars, the differences are larger than the given uncertainties. To investigate the diverging results, we asses non-LTE effects in the parameter range of M dwarfs for K and Fe. Non-LTE effects are negligible for Fe I in M-dwarf atmospheres but are important for K I. These effects, leading to potassium abundance and metallicity corrections on the order of 0.2 dex, may be responsible for some of these discrepancies. The aim is to validate and improve the method of fitting synthetic spectra to observed spectra for M dwarfs.</td>

On this basis, we investigated whether any of the TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) coincided with such observations, from which we find 18 single planet candidate systems. Of these, one exhibits an RV signature that has the correct period and phase matching the transiting planetary candidate with a false alarm probability of less than 1 percent.

This planet is less than 4 Earth Radii and has better than 33 percent planetary mass measurements, thus advancing the TESS primary objective of finding 50 such worlds.

Several processes contribute to this variability, including magnetic activity, pulsations, and granulation. Many previous studies have focused on techniques to mitigate signals from pulsations and magnetic activity. We will explore the impact of the shifting and skewing of spectral lines by turbulent granulation cells, an effect which has only been partially addressed by empirically-motivated observation strategies and 3D MHD simulations. Since granular motions imprint their effects on spectral lines differently than magnetic activity, a new approach to mitigating spectral variability due to granulation may be required. To aid in this effort, we have developed a tool that generates synthetic stellar spectral time series using spatially- and temporally-resolved solar observations as input. This tool, which we dub the GRanulation And Spectrum Simulator (GRASS), is the first empirical model for spectral line variability in a star with known center-of-mass radial velocity behavior. We present GRASS, explain its methodology, and discuss its implications for disentangling the effects of granular noise from true Doppler shifts.</td>

Using these atmospheres we first calculated the center-to-limb variation of spot intensity contrasts at different wavelengths for all of the spectral types. Finally, we generated synthetic line profiles for different features on the stellar disk - quiet star, umbra, penumbra, and plage and combined them to create disk integrated line profiles. These profiles were then used toquantify the effects of starspots with different filling factors on the radial velocity (RV) of stars. Our realistic atmospheres offer us the opportunity to incorporate, for the first time, the effect of flows within starspots in synthetic RV calculations.</td>

Using SDO data on the Sun’s magnetic field as  input, I integrated over the solar disk to model the net effect on the Fe I 15648.5Å line and found that the difference in the line shape between a low-activity and a high-activity day is easily detectable with an SNR of 1,000. In the future, I will refine this method working with high-SNR (easily ≥1,000) solar spectra obtained through laser heterodyne radiometry (LHR), which involves using a single-frequency laser to heterodyne an IR spectrum down to radio frequencies. Using this technique on disk-integrated solar spectra will pave the way for mitigating magnetic activity-induced noise in IR spectra of nearby stars, enabling RV measurement precision down to the 10cm/s level.</td>

There is considerable evidence from spectroscopic and photometric observations that both terrestrial and gas-giant planets are capable of surviving post-main sequence evolution and migrating into the WD phase. WDs are also capable of hosting stable Habitable Zones outside orbital distances at which Earth-mass planets would be disintegrated by tidal forces. To reach the WD phase, a main-sequence star has to progress along the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) around which Circumstellar Envelopes (CSEs) are found to be rich in some of the simple molecules from which amino acids and simple sugars can be synthesised. It is found that in addition to retaining most of a 1bar atmosphere, planets at orbital distances equivalent to Saturn and the Kuiper Belt would be able to accrete between 1 and 20 times the mass of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere from the CSE, and therefore likely a sufficiently high mass of prebiotic material to be useful in facilitating the emergence of life.</td>

JWST will offer unprecedented insight into the atmospheric composition of potentially habitable gas dwarf planets through transmission and emission spectroscopy, whose reducing atmospheres have entirely different chemistry from an inhabited Earth-like planet with an oxidizing atmosphere. We investigate the detectability of NH3 (ammonia, a potential biosignature) in the atmospheres of seven potentially habitable gas dwarf planets using various JWST instruments (NIRISS, NIRSpec, and MIRI).

<td align="left">High precision radial velocity (RV) measurements have led to the need of better diagnosing stellar activity in exoplanet detections. Here we introduce the magnitude-square coherence as a diagnostic of activity-driven RV variations. This analysis is done in the frequency domain by estimating the cross and auto correlation between RV and an activity indicator. The coherence coefficient shows that values near zero indicate that the activity indicator is not a good predictor of RV, while values near one mean that RV is well modeled by the activity indicator. We studied the coherence method using observations of HD 26965 and CoRoT-7. For CoRoT-7, the stellar RV signals from the literature are coherent with at least one activity indicator, while the planet signal reported by Queloz et. al (2009) does not show up in any of the coherences. The analysis of HD 26965 reveals that the proposed planet signal from Díaz et al. (2018) has a significant coherence with the H-alpha measurements. Furthermore, the separation between the planet and rotation frequencies are almost indistinguishable based on their Rayleigh criterion, suggesting that the planet period comes from HD26965’s rotation Ultimately, our results demonstrate that coherence can diagnose frequencies where stellar activity manifests in the RVs.</td>

Yet the intermediate K stars provide an appealing compromise between these two extremes that has been relatively unexplored. Compared to solar-type stars, K stars are more abundant, maintain longer main-sequence lifetimes, and their planets are more suitable to observations based on the mass and radius ratios of the planet to star. While M stars also excel in these regards, they have been observed to have frequent flares with ultraviolet (UV) energies over 100 times greater than anything observed in the recent history of our Sun. Therefore, K stars may provide &ldquo;super-habitable&rdquo; environments for exoplanets that are more easily detectable and characterizable. Understanding the UV radiation incident on planets is pivotal in determining the habitability of any planets orbiting these stars, as well as our ability to observe any potential biosignatures in their atmospheres. With this aim, we observed a sample of K stars in the near-UV and far-UV at three representative ages using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to spectroscopically analyze the UV evolution of K stars.

K2-25b&rsquo;s youth and its similarities with Gl 436b suggest that K2-25b could be undergoing strong atmospheric escape.

We present the first ALMA detection of CO gas co-located with impact-produced debris in orbit around the 23 Myr old A star HD 172555. Spectral modeling shows that CO is distributed in a ring centered at 7.5 AU, with a width of 3.3 AU.  The dust composition, size distribution, mass, as well as the presence and morphology of CO gas, indicate that the gas and dust are unlikely to be primordial, originating in an in-situ asteroid belt, or transported inwards from an external, as-yet unobserved belt.  On the other hand, a planetary impact between volatile rich Earth/super-Earth sized bodies &gt;0.2 Myr ago can explain the observed dust and gas properties. Specifically, with a progenitor mass of ≈5 earth masses, either an immediate atmospheric stripping event of a heavy, CO₂ dominated atmosphere, or a prolonged thermal stripping scenario of a light, H₂/He dominated atmosphere are plausible.

Using data from the Kepler spacecraft, we use the starspot modeling program STSP to measure the position and size of spots for KOI-340 (WISE J195039.52+474804.8) which is an eclipsing binary consisting of Solar-type star ($M_{*} = 1.10 \pm 0.07 M_{\odot}$) with an M-dwarf companion ($M_{*} = 0.214 \pm 0.006 M_{\odot}$).   STSP uses a novel technique to measure the spot positions and radii by using the transiting secondary as a magnifying glass to probe down to less than 1% changes in the surface brightness of the star for high-precision photometry.  Preliminary results show the minimum size of spot features on KOI-340 is 10% the size of the star i.e. two times larger than the size of the majority of Sunspots and Sunspot groups at Solar maximum (Howard et al. 1984).  Though KOI-340 has a similar $T_{eff}$ (5770 K) as the Sun, it rotates at a rate of 12.9 days, which is ≈2 times faster than the Sun and could be contributing to the larger spots.  A similar analysis showed that a K4 dwarf HAT-P-11 has similar size spots as the Sun, but there are ≈100x more of them (Morris et al. 2017).  This analysis is part of a larger program to characterize starspot properties using high precision transiting exoplanet light curves across a range of spectral types and rotation rates.

We analyze the sensitivity of our biosignature yield metrics and other derived stellar properties, such as masses and ages, to stellar model uncertainties and systematic uncertainties in observed stellar properties.

<td align="left">Jason Williams (University of Southern California / Carnegie Observatories). <em>Design and Development of Henrietta, a high-precision ground-based NIR spectrograph to detect exoplanet atmospheres</em>. <strong>7.2</strong></td>
<td align="left">Henrietta is a near-infrared (NIR) long-slit/multi-object cryogenic spectrograph to be deployed at the 1-m Swope Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Henrietta is designed to survey the molecular content of exoplanet atmospheres from .97 – 1.8 microns at a resolution of 200. The primary driver of Henrietta is the noticeable gap in ground-based spectrophotometric precision from the optical to the infrared and the need for high precision spectrophotometric follow ups relevant to JWST. I will discuss how Henrietta seeks to resolve this gap and achieve near photon-noise limited observations by mitigating three insidious sources of noise and systematics: atmospheric scintillation, NIR sky emission, and subpixel quantum-efficiency fluctuations in H2RG arrays. Henrietta will have first light in August of 2022 and if it reaches its design goal it will enable the robust detection of exoatmospheres from the ground, become a ‘finder scope’ for JWST, and act as a testbed for future instruments to achieve high spectrophotometric precision from the ground.</td>

<td align="left">Clouds substantially impact the climate and atmospheric structure of worlds throughout our Solar System. Furthermore, a critical feature of habitable planets, like our Earth, is that a substantial fraction of their visible disk is obscured by clouds. Ultimately, as the James Webb Space Telescope and other key observational facilities become operational, forward model sophistication must also evolve. One-dimensional planetary atmosphere models offer a powerful and computationally efficient approach to exploring a broad range of planetary and atmospheric conditions while preserving radiative transfer sophistication. Here we couple CLIMA (Kasting 1988; Kopparapu et al. 2013) to a well-established one-dimensional microphysical cloud model (Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001) via a two-column (clear versus clouded) treatment of the atmosphere, following Marley et al. (2010).    The most well-known terrestrial planet whose climate heavily depends on the influence of clouds is Earth. Thus, we present a validation of our new Microphysical Cloudy-clear Climate Model (MCCM) against Earth, following similar techniques outlined in Kopparapu et al. (2013).  The development of this next-generation one-dimensional climate model seeds opportunities to explore cloud-influenced Habitable Zones (Kopparapu et al. 2013) and myriad explorations of unique exoplanet climates.</td>

<td align="left">Transit and eclipse spectroscopy offer insights into the chemical and radiative properties of extrasolar planets, but inferring said properties from their spectra requires data-model comparisons. Typically, Bayesian atmospheric retrieval methods have been used to derive these properties. Retrievals generally make minimal assumptions allowing for more flexibility in the fits and potentially illuminating unknown physics, but this also creates the possibility of unphysical atmospheric determinations. In this work, we combine Bayesian parameter estimation tools with a new grid of self-consistent, one-dimensional, radiative-convective equilibrium models. We constrain metallicities, carbon-to-oxygen ratios, and heat redistributions for a population of hot Jupiters from their dayside thermal emission spectra, using data from a uniform data-reduction of Hubble WFC3 and Spitzer observations. The self-consistent approach mitigates the possibility of unphysical solutions, resulting in robust atmospheric inferences. We will present our self-consistent constraints on these fundamental atmospheric properties in the context of current retrieval results, and compare our findings to predictions from planet formation theories. Our nominal model fits to each object will be extrapolated to the James Webb Space Telescope wavelengths, as well as high-resolution, cross-correlation instruments, in order to identify observational setups that best address any degeneracies.</td>

<td align="left">Debris disk morphology provides information about the dynamical environment of circumstellar dust. Asymmetry and other shape distortions can signal that the disk is interacting with the ISM or being stirred by nearby planets. For this study, we analyzed GPI corona graphic images of the disk around HD 15115, dubbed the “blue needle.” Previous studies with STIS, SPHERE, and ALMA have shown a brightness asymmetry and suggested that two distinct dust belts might orbit the star. Our analysis reveals the same brightness asymmetry, plus a warp on the Eastern limb. A future research goal is to search for evidence of a second dust belt.</td>

<td align="left">Tze Yeung Mathew Yu (UCLA). <em>Assembly of Super-Earth Systems in a Magnetospherically Truncated Protoplanetary Disk</em>. <strong>3.8</strong></td>
<td align="left">In the last decade, many works tried to explain the origin of the observed close-in Super-Earth and Sub-Neptune population using type-I migration during the protoplanetary disk phase; it is anticipated that disk-planet interaction moves them close to their host stars and the migrational effect is negated near 10-days orbit by invoking planet trap. Most works assume truncations in the protoplanetary disks caused by the host stars&rsquo; magnetic field and employ sharp drop-offs in surface densities to model the truncations. In this presentation, we will show that we can construct a more realistic model by re-applying existing accretion disk model around white dwarfs to protoplanetary disks accreting onto their host star. In our model, we consider not only the host star’s magnetic field truncating the disk but also the field diffusing into the inner region of the disk. We treat both accretion heating in the disk and passive heating from the host star self-consistently. We will demonstrate that model parameters, such as magnetic-field strengths and profiles, strongly affect the migrational behavior of planets in our model, which is critical in understanding the orbital distribution of observed close-in super-Earths. A subset of our parameter is able to produce populations similar to observations.</td>

<td align="left">Radio interferometers incompletely and noisily sample the visibility function of an astronomical source, making the recovery of the true sky brightness distribution an ill-defined inverse problem. While image-plane deconvolution algorithms like CLEAN have been the go-to tool for most radio astronomers, recently, Regularized Maximum Likelihood (RML) imaging techniques have shown potential to synthesize images with better angular resolution and image fidelity, especially for continuum observations (e.g., see EHT M87 results). Building on this momentum, we are developing algorithms that extend RML imaging algorithms to ALMA spectral line observations, which will be useful for the kinematic detection of planets in protoplanetary disks and finely detailed astrochemical characterization. As part of this effort, we are vetting several “image priors” to identify the most useful for the varied morphologies of spectral line emission. In this presentation I will discuss the foundational principles of RML imaging and describe our ongoing work in designing a community-facing Python package for ALMA spectral line imaging.</td>

<td align="left">Jinglin Zhao (Penn State University). <em>FourIEr phase SpecTrum Analysis (FIESTA) to disentangle planets from stellar activities</em>. <strong>2.7</strong></td>
<td align="left">In the radial velocity detection of exoplanets, the planetary signal, i.e., the Keplerian Doppler wobbling of stars can be mimicked by stellar activities that deform the spectral line profiles, which results in apparent radial velocity shifts. Traditionally, stellar activity indicators assist in ruling out false planet detections but lacks robustness and consistency.   We’ve been developing the FourIEr phase SpecTrum Analysis (FIESTA) to parametrise spectral line profile variability in Fourier space for this challenge. The cross-correlation function of each stellar spectrum is decomposed into Fourier basis functions and parametrised by their amplitudes and phases. We show such a parametrisation preserves all the information of the line profile and robustly traces the line variability, with examples of the SOAP solar simulations and the 3 years of HARPS-N solar observations.</td>
