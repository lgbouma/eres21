      <description>Hugo has figure shortcode built in, so you can easily add figcaptions or hyperlink rel attributes to images. Documentations can be found here:
https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure
This theme has 3 CSS classes made for figure elements:
 big: images will break the width limit of main content area. left: images will float to the left. right: images will float to the right.  If a figure has no class set, the image will behave just like a normal markdown image: !</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Hugo</title>

      <description>Step 1. Install Hugo Go to Hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your OS and architecture.
Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at Install Hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:
 Clone the Hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313  Corresponding pseudo commands:</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Welcome! We are pleased to announce the sixth Emerging Researchers in Exoplanet Science Symposium (ERES), to be held May 24-26, 2021.
ERES is aimed at early career scientists (graduate student, postdoc, advanced undergraduate) working in all branches of exoplanetary science and related disciplines. Its purpose is to give these emerging researchers the opportunity to present their research to an interested audience, to provide opportunities to network with peers, and to enhance collaborations within the exoplanet community.</description>

      <description>How does ERES differ from a typical conference? The ERES meeting is explicitly designed for and by &amp;ldquo;emerging&amp;rdquo; researchers, including graduate students, postdocs, and advanced undergraduates. The vast majority of the scientific talks will be given by postdocs and PhD students. The scientific discussion will also be driven by junior scientists. Although most of the time will be devoted to scientific talks, the organizing committee is also planning a few panel discussions on professional development topics.</description>
