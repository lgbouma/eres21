# Schedule

The meeting will run from (roughly) 1pm to 5pm Eastern on May 24 through May
26.  There are a total of 50 scheduled talks (10+3 minutes), two poster
sessions, two discussion panels, and two rounds of poster pops.  The talks are
split 50:50 in time between plenary and simultaneous sessions.  Per popular
request, Tuesday evening we will be hosting a trivia night.  Bring your A-game!

The _discussion panels_ will be held on the topics of career development and
public engagement.  For our public engagement panel, we look forward to
welcoming [Mark Newhouse](https://www.noao.edu/outreach/epostaff/mark)
(NOIRLab/Gemini Observatory), [Jessie
Christiansen](http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/christia/) (Caltech
IPAC/NExScI), and [David
Kipping](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~dkipping/index.html) (Columbia).  For
our career development panel, we will be welcoming [Megan
Shabram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meganshabram) (Bountiful), [Ian
Czekala](https://sites.psu.edu/iczekala/) (Penn State), and [Susan
Mullally](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-directory/susan-e-mullally)
(STScI).

We hope that the schedule will provide time for scientific discussion via zoom
and slack, and for interacting with each other in a less structured format via
gather.
