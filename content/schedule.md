# Schedule

The meeting will run from (roughly) 1pm to 5pm Eastern on May 24 through May
26.  There are a total of 50 scheduled talks (10+3 minutes), two poster
sessions, two discussion panels, and two rounds of poster pops.  The talks are
split 50:50 in time between plenary and simultaneous sessions.  Per popular
